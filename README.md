# IEE380-Mini-Project-Boxes-Tester-code

This is testing this problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem

Download both files, then in console type "make" 

After which type "./BoxProb \<Amount of people> \<Amount of trials> \<Method> \<info>"

Methods: 

1: Randomly pick boxes

2: Pick box based on what was given from the previous box

Info:

1: Show successes from a trial without any extra text 

2: Show successes from a trial in a formal way 

3: Show successes from trials that has every person guess right 

4: Both 2 & 4

I would recommend 100 people, 100 trials, Try both methods, and either 3 or 4.

EX: ./BoxProb 100 100 2 3
