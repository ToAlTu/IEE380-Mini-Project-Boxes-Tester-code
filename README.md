# IEE380-Mini-Project-Boxes-Tester-code

This is testing this problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem

Download both files, then in console type "make" 

After which type "./BoxProb \<Amount of people> \<Amount of trials> \<Method> \<info>"

Methods: \n
1: Randomly pick boxes \n
2: Pick box based on what was given from the previous box

Info: \n
1: Show successes from a trial without any extra text \n
2: Show successes from a trial in a formal way \n
3: Show successes from trials that has every person guess right \n
4: Both 2 & 4

I would recommend 100 people, 100 trials, Try both methods, and either 3 or 4.

EX: ./BoxProb 100 100 2 3
